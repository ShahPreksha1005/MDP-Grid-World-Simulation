# MDP-Grid-World-Simulation
A demonstration of the Markov Decision Process (MDP) in a 3x3 grid environment. The agent navigates the grid to reach a goal while maximizing cumulative rewards. This project illustrates key MDP concepts, including states, actions, rewards, and transition probabilities, with visualization of the agentâ€™s path.
